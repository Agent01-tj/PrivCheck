PrivCheck - Windows Privilege Auditor
Purpose:
Identifies high-risk security privileges on Windows systems that could enable privilege escalation attacks. Designed for system administrators and security professionals to audit account permissions.

Key Features:

Dangerous Privilege Detection
Scans for 6 critical privileges:

SeDebugPrivilege (memory access)

SeImpersonatePrivilege (security context impersonation)

SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege (process token replacement)

SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege (object ownership takeover)

SeBackup/SeRestorePrivilege (ACL bypass)

Risk Assessment
Classifies findings into:

üü¢ LOW (0-1 privileges)

üü° MEDIUM (2-3 privileges)

üî¥ HIGH (4+ privileges)

Automated Reporting
Generates timestamped audit logs with:

Privilege status (Enabled/Disabled)

Impact analysis

Mitigation steps

System metadata (user/host/timestamp)

Remediation Guidance
Provides actionable steps to harden systems via:

Least privilege enforcement

Security Policy (secpol.msc) configuration

Service account auditing procedures

Usage Requirements:
‚ö†Ô∏è Requires administrative rights for full system visibility. Warns when run without elevation.

Output Example:

text
[!!!] SECURITY ALERT: 3 DANGEROUS PRIVILEGES FOUND [!!!]
Privileges: SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege
Threat Level: MEDIUM
Security Impact:
  [DEBUG]    Debug programs (Memory access)
  [IMPERSON] Impersonate security contexts
  [OWNER]    Take object ownership
Ideal For:

Proactive system hardening

Privilege escalation vulnerability checks

Security compliance audits

Administrator account reviews

This tool helps prevent lateral movement and privilege escalation by identifying overly permissive account settings in Windows environments. The batch script implementation makes it portable and executable without dependencies.
